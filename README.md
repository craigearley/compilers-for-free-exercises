# "Compilers for Free" exercises

This repository contains exercises from the talk-turned-article ["Compilers for Free"](https://codon.com/compilers-for-free).

## Why I did these exercises

I did fine in my Programming Languages course as a student, but I was never fully confident with interpreters and compilers in practice. People (accurately!) talk about building such programs as "metaprogramming", but as a student I found they always came across as more handwavey or tautological than meta.

This exercise, which I'd emphasize consists of code built by someone else ([Tom Codon](https://codon.com)) in 2013 for demo purposes and not by me, was clarifying. Meticulously walking through it gave me a better intuition for interpreters and compilers - which are not, in fact, handwavey or tautological. :) The Futamura projections at the end of the article were particularly illuminating to discover and think through.
